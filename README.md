# Breast-Cancer-classication-using-CNN

Breast cancer affects the females in the ratio of 1:8 across the globe. It is discovered by detecting the malicious cells of breast tissue. Modern medical image processing techniques work on histopathology images captured by a microscope, and then analyze them by using different algorithms and techniques. At present, ML algorithms are now being used to process medical imagery and pathological tools. Manual detection of a cancer cell is a tedious job and involves human error, and therefore computer-based mechanisms are put in to execute for better score considered with manual pathological detection systems. Usually, this is finished with the help of extraction features through a convolutional neural network (CNN) and further categorized using a fully connected network. Deep learning is broadly used in the medical imaging field, as it does not require prior expertise in a related field. In this report, we have trained a convolutional neural network and determined a prediction accuracy up to 98.3%.
